Description: search quickly through entire file systems
 Glimpse, which stands for GLobal IMPlicit SEarch, is a very popular
 UNIX indexing and query system that allows you to search through a
 large set of files very quickly. Glimpse supports most of agrep's
 options (agrep is our powerful version of grep) including approximate
 matching (e.g., finding misspelled words), Boolean queries, and even
 some limited forms of regular expressions.
